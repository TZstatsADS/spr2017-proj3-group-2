### Code lib Folder - image pre-processing and feature selection

1. Make sure folders data/output and data/output2 are empty.

2. Pre-process images using one of the three methods of feature.R.

3. Store pre-processed images in data/images.

4. Select features with extract_sift.m. The script represents each image by a vector of 5000 numbers and outputs a data/output/.csv, which is to be fed to training.R. Run time of this script is around 13 minutes for a folder of 2000 images.
