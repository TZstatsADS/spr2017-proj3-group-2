In Black and White. \n![image](figs/poodleKFC.jpg)\n\n### [Full Project Description](doc/project3_desc.html)\n\nTerm: Spring 2017\n\n+ Team #2\n+ Team members\n\t+ Ka Heng (Helen) Lo\n\t+ Jia Hui Tan\n\t+ Bo Peng - *Presenter\n\t+ Yingxin Zhang\n\t+ Yao Tvan\n\n+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for grayscale images of poodles versus grayscale images of fried chicken. \n\t\n**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) \n+ Ka Heng (Helen) Lo: \n\t+ Wrote function to tune parameters for XGBoost model and function to train the *best* XGBoost model; tuned & trained based on SIFT features and three new feature sets \n\t+ Wrote individual functions to tune parameters for SVM with linear kernel, SVM with RBF (radial) kernel, AdaBag model, AdaBoost.M1 model, AdaBoost_SAMME model, and KNN model; tuned based on original SIFT features\n\t+ Wrote individual functions to train *best* SVM with linear kernel, SVM with RBF (radial) kernel, AdaBag model, AdaBoost.M1 model, AdaBoost_SAMME model, and KNN model; trained based on original SIFT features \n\t+ Wrote main.Rmd script with summary table outputs for model selection process for Advanced Model; edited files in lib folder to allow for easy reproducibility of model selection process\n\t+ Wrote train.R\n\t+ Wrote test.R\n\t\n+ Jia Hui Tan: \n\t+ Wrote function to tune GBM (baseline model) and function to train *best* GBM; tuned & trained based on SIFT features and three new feature sets\n\t\n+ Bo Peng: \n\t+ Feature Extraction: SIFT- resize+adaptive, SIFT- resize, SIFT- adaptive\n\t+ Prepared presentation\n\t\n+ Yingxin Zhang: \n\t+ Pre-process images\n\t+ Wrote function to train a CNN model; trained and tested model with training images split into a training set and test set\n\t\n+ Yao Tvan: \n\t+ \n\n\nFollowing [suggestions](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) by [RICH FITZJOHN](http://nicercode.github.io/about/#Team) (@richfitz).
